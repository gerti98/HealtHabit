# Descrizione
Due to the health emergency caused by Covid-19, starting from March 2020, many patients have fallen behind in therapeutic diagnostic care pathways, in new diagnoses, in follow-up visits or in routine examinations. Furthermore, the situation is aggravated by the total lack of data which prevents us from being able to quantify the health damage caused to citizens who have not been able to undergo these services

The HealthHabit project aims to help you keep track of all the exams you have to take during the year. Through an ad-hoc developed and already functioning app, the user is invited to fill in various surveys relating to routine exams or lifestyle in order to give targeted advice regarding possible visits to be made.

Application data is collected anonymously and presented in a dashboard for statistical purposes.


## Features 
   * Supported by the components of the [Ionic] framework (https://ionicframework.com/), the app has an easy and intuitive interface, suitable for all ages.
   * The application is also prepared to be integrated with the IO APP, being created with the same technology, and with the MioDottore.it portal to book the exams recommended by the application quickly and easily.
   * Dashboard that aggregates data generated by users and allows consultation for statistical purposes
